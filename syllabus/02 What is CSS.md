01 - What is CSS?
===============

> CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. HTML was never intended to control the formatting of the items on the page, that is why CSS was created. CSS controls both formatting and position of elements on an HTML page.

***

#### Syntax
> Standard CSS has 2 available declarations. Classes and ID tags. 

##### Targeting an element with a class

```css
/* Class */
.element {
    
}
```

```html
<div class="element"></div>
```

##### Targeting an element with an ID

```css
/* ID */
#element {
    
}
```

```html
<div id="element"></div>
```

#### The use of comments
> Comments are used to make notes in a css document. These are not visible to the user, but are visible when reading the page source. 

```css
/* This is a CSS comment */
```

### Requirement: Valid HTML
> Have valid, semantically correct HTML markup. 

Note: Use an online HTML validator to be sure you code is compliant. We are developing to the HTML5 standard. 

### Requirement: Valid CSS
> Have valid, semantically correct CSS markup in an external file. You can use CSS3 provided that all major browsers support the tags.  

### Requirement: Use a variance of tags in your code that conform to valid markup, easily readable to screen readers.

### Summary
> At the conclusion of the class, we will have a discussion about what you liked, what you didnt like and anything else you want to discuss. I welcome constructive criticism and know the only way to get better is by analyzing deficiencies in the course. You can shape how we teach.
